# to-do-list

A simple CRUD application that let you make a list of things to do in order to manage your daily tasks.

Build with React, HTML, CSS, Redux, MongoDB Atlas and Express

## How to run this app locally

NOTE: you need the port 3000 and the 3001 to be free

In the "./to_do_list_API" folder run the command:

node index.js

After the server start, on the path "./to_do_list" run the command:

npm start

In order to start the client-side.

And that's all, now you can use the to do list!
